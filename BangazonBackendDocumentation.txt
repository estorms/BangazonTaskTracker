BANGAZON TASKTRACKER TaskTracker project:

This project backend was built in VisualStudio 2015,
ASP.NET MVC WEB API, with EntityFramework, Moq, utilizing 
the Respository Pattern.

All methods begin within the Data Abstraction Layer, (DAL). 
The DAL holds two files:  
  
  UserTaskContext.cs holds the DbSet<UserTask> which
  is the entry point of the application.  
  
  UserTaskRespository holds all methods that are used 
  in the application.
  
The TaskTrackerController is the controller which calls
the methods that are defined within the DAL>UserTaskRepository.
This controller is the one which contains all http requests
to the database.

There is one table: UserTask.cs and its properties are:
  
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Description { get; set; }
  public TaskStatus Status { get; set; }
  public DateTime? CompletedOn { get; set; }
  
  public enum TaskStatus
    {
        ToDo,
        InProgress,
        Complete
    }

To create a frontend, the developer needs to code http requests
to the UserTaskController.
